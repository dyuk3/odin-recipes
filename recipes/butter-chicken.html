    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Chicken Makhani is one of my favorite Indian dishes. It is a full flavored dish that complements the chicken well. It can be made as mild or spicy as you wish by adjusting the cayenne. Serve with basmati rice and naan bread.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon peanut oil</li>
        <li>Â¼ white onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Saute shallot and onion until soft and translucent. Stir in butter, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, 1 teaspoon garam masala, chili powder, cumin and bay leaf. Cook, stirring, for
            1 minute. Add tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Season with salt pepper. Remove from heat and set aside.

        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat, and season with 1 teaspoon garam masala and cayenne. Stir in a few spoonfuls of sauce, and simmer until liquid
            has reduced, and chicken is no longer pink. Stir cooked chicken into sauce.</li>
        <li>Mix together cornstarch and water, then stir into the sauce. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until thickened.</li>
